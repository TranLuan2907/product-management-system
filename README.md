# STORE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

This is my first project for subject LAB211 in FPT University, which is design a simple software with various options for a convenience store.

## Project Description

A convenience store sells 2 groups of products: products for daily use (bread, dumplings, sticky rice, ...) and
products with long shelf life such as cookies, soft drinks, filtered water, .... The product.dat file is used to store
information of all products in the Store. The wareHouse.dat file has stored import/export information. Each
import/export receipt can contain many different items with different quantities.

1.1. Add a Product.

1.2. Update Product Information.

1.3. Delete Product.

1.4. Show All Products.

**Manage Warehouse**

2.1. Create an Import Receipt.

2.2. Create an Export Receipt.

**Report**

3.1. Products that Have Expired.

3.2. The Products that the Store Is Selling.

3.4. Import/Export Receipt of a Product.

4. Store Data to Files

5. Close the Application

Each menu choice should invoke an appropriate function to perform the selected menu item. Your program must display the menu. After each task, the application should wait for the user to select another option until the user chooses to quit the program.

Just a simple guy with a passionate love for coding. Hugely inspired by Giao Lang, also known as Hoang Nguyen The. I look forward to attending his class someday.

Special thanks to **Pham Nguyen Trong Tuan (K17 HCM)** for giving a demo so that it helps me visualize how to build this project.

This project was awarded full **500 locs** by lecturer **ThongNT.**
